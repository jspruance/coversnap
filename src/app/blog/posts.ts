## 🎯 Why a Cover Letter Still Matters

Even in tech, a good cover letter can:

- Show your communication skills  
- Explain gaps or transitions (e.g. bootcamp, career switch)  
- Align your experience with the job description  

Many engineers skip it — but that’s your opportunity to stand out.

2. **What you bring to the table** – Highlight skills like React, Python, cloud infrastructure, etc.  
3. **Why this company** – Mention tech stack, mission, or product  
4. **A confident close** – Invite further conversation or interview
