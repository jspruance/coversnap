## 🎯 Why a Cover Letter Still Matters

Even in tech, a good cover letter can:

- Show your communication skills  
- Explain gaps or transitions (e.g. bootcamp, career switch)  
- Align your experience with the job description  

Many engineers skip it — but that’s your opportunity to stand out.

## 🛠️ What to Include in a Software Engineer Cover Letter

Keep it simple and focused. Include:

1. **A strong opening line** – Hook them with enthusiasm or mission-fit  
2. **What you bring to the table** – Highlight skills like React, Python, cloud infrastructure, etc.  
3. **Why this company** – Mention tech stack, mission, or product  
4. **A confident close** – Invite further conversation or interview

## ✍️ Example Opening Paragraph

> _“I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer role at Acme Inc. As a full-stack developer with 3 years of experience building React and Node.js apps, I was especially drawn to your focus on scalable, privacy-first technology.”_

Keep it concise. No need to restate your entire resume.
